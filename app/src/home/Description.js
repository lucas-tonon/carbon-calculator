      Many things we do on a daily basis generate emissions that can contribute to the greenhouse effect.
      Given our current emergency regarding the climate crisis it may be interesting to do an estimate of how much carbon we emit in our
      lives, which could help us reduce our current carbon emissions and help the environment.

      This calculator was based on <EPACalculatorLink />,
      however, being a simple side-project the current calculator does not have many of the features included in the reference example.

      Here we focused on generating an estimate of the total emissions of a given user by their input regarding Electricity, Heating, and Transportation.

      The values used by the application were taken from the document <EPAEmissionFactorsLink />. I tried making this calculator as easy to improve as possible, by
      making all parts modularized and having options regarding the Emission Factors.
